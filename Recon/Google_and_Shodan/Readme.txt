Sharing my presentation of Google dorking and Shodan. Learning google hacking is skill that once you have learned you will use it in personal and professional life. Google dorking is a very essential skill for hacker. It can be used by people who are not in cyber security to get accurate result in desire format quickly. Like google, Shodan is also a search engine but it's for IoT devices (devices that are connected to internet). Using Shodan you can get to know what type of deceives are connected to internet and various other details about the system like open ports, screenshot of system, honeypot tagging and many more. Shodan should be used in red teaming assessment of the organization to increase the attack vector.
